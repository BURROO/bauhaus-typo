I'll let here some notes on the current progress of the site and on the problem
I'm facing right now. For clarity sake I'll divide the notes according to the four buttons:

BEGINNING
    I decided to keep the panel simple, with just the description of the project and the short video appearing at the beginning 

ORIGINALS
    in this section I wanted to make a scrollable gallery but i'm still managing how to make it scrollable because by now it's still. Also I need to figure out how to make the modal (opening of one single picture at a time) working and how to divide the pictures in categories

FONT
    my plan was to make a scrollable gallery also in this section but somehow is not working even if the code should be alright and iven if i tested it in a differnt file (it was working)
    also, i decided, due to the really short time available, to delete the category-sorting of the images in this section.

INTERACT
     I made this section almost fully work, I'm still missing just the "references" part



A problem I'm now facing is how to make the letters from the interact section diappear when going back to the previous ones
